================================

Repository for Coursera Practical Machine Learning course final project

Course project graders, 

No need to download html file.  Here are the two ways to read .html in GitHub directly without having to down load the html file: 

(1) You can get a decent preview .html by clicking on .md file .

Or

(2) Add http://htmlpreview.github.com/? in front of  the url of the html file.
For example: To read my course project .html fiie, please click on this link here: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lmcmahan/practicalMachineLearningCoursera/blob/master/practicalMachineLearningCourseProject.html

I got this helpful info from this link: http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/topic13_make-browsing-GitHub-repo-more-rewarding.html
